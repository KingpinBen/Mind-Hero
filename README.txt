The game code for "Mind Hero" for our third year group project for 2012->2013.
The project is for Unity3D v4.0<4.2

This game went through many iterations in design and probably features a lot of unused code in places. I was doing solely doing the programming on 2 projects (this and the Last Faun) at once so I was just trying to get the game to a working state.

The idea of the game is to move tiny blob people into the correct rooms inside Brian's (the protagonist) head in time for when the blocks reach a point onscreen (much like how notes work in Rockband, Guitar Hero style games).
